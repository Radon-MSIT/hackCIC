### Problem
When a crop is harvested, it is transferred to Storage Houses. Here crops are stored until they are transferred to a particular State to be retailed. But sometimes this crop is not transferred within the expiration date of the stock. Hence the crop is detoriated or is eventually consumed by rats.

### Idea
We plan on to create a real time crop-stock data monitoring and prompting system to manage data of diffenent Storage Houses all over the country.

### Solution

We'll do this by providing cloud Database access to the Storage Houses where officials will record all the incoming and outgoing of crop-stock. This data will be used in two ways :

- To notify States about the availability of crops in a particular stock house if they lack it. Often there is lack of crops in particular state and abundancy in other state. This problem is resolved

- To notify farmers about the crops which are already high in stock, so that they won't cultivate it. Instead they will cultivate a crop which is high on demand and low on stock. This will help in reducing inflation and farmers will get good money for their crops.

### Side-by-side

Farmers do not have access to technology for an app or a website. They are solely dependent on Kisaan Helpline. So we will allow access to the insights of the data recieved above to the Kisaan Call Centers. They could further communicate these insights to the farmers.
