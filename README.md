### Problem
When a crop is harvested, it is transferred to Storage Houses. Here crops are stored until they are transferred to a particular State to be retailed. But sometimes this crop is not transferred within the expiration date of the stock. Hence the crop is detoriated or is eventually consumed by rats.

### Idea
We plan on to create a real time crop-stock data monitoring and prompting system to manage data of diffenent Storage Houses all over the country.
